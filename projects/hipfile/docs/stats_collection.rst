Stats Collection Tool
=====================

``ais-stats`` collects runtime hipFile I/O statistics from an application.
Use it for quick performance checks and backend-path validation.

Command-line Tool
-----------------
``ais-stats`` can be run in two modes:
* ``$ ais-stats -p <PID> [-i]`` collects stats from a running process.
  ``-i`` reports immediately rather than waiting for process exit.
* ``$ ais-stats <program> [args...]`` launches ``<program>`` with the
  provided arguments and reports stats after waiting for the process to exit.

Quick start examples: ::

    $ export HIPFILE_STATS_LEVEL=1
    $ ais-stats -p 12345

    $ HIPFILE_STATS_LEVEL=1 ais-stats ./my_app --input data.bin

Configuration
-------------
Collection is controlled by the environment variable ``HIPFILE_STATS_LEVEL``.

===== =================================================
Value Description
===== =================================================
0     Disabled
1     Basic (default value)
2     Detailed (currently same as basic; reserved for future use)
===== =================================================

Stats Collected
---------------
* Basic: Bytes read/written on the fastpath/fallback backends.
* Basic: Bandwidth for reads/writes on the fastpath/fallback backends.
* Basic: Latency for reads/writes on the fastpath/fallback backends.
* Basic: I/O error counts for reads/writes on the fastpath/fallback backends.
* Basic: Histograms of above stats broken into buckets based on the size of the I/O.

Output
------
The report shows total counters for each metric, followed by histograms of the metrics broken down by I/O size.

Scope and Limitations
---------------------
* Reported values reflect hipFile-managed I/O paths.
* Stats are broken out by backend to help identify fastpath/fallback usage.
* Detailed mode (``HIPFILE_STATS_LEVEL=2``) is reserved for future expansion.
* Stats collection is only available on systems with a Linux kernel version 5.3 or later.

Troubleshooting
---------------
* No report produced: ensure ``HIPFILE_STATS_LEVEL`` is set to ``1`` or ``2``,
  verify ``ais-stats`` is available in ``PATH``, and confirm the target process
  performed hipFile I/O.
* ``-p <PID>`` attach fails: verify the PID exists and that the current user
  has permission to inspect it.
* Unexpected zero values: confirm the workload exercised the expected backend
  and operation type.

* See :doc:`fio` for a benchmark workflow that can generate I/O activity.
